# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

As members, contributors, and leaders, we are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of their age and body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnic origin, sexual characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of expertise, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to acting and interacting in a way that contributes to an open, welcoming, and diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:

* Showing empathy and kindness to others
* Respecting different opinions, points of view, and experiences
* Gracefully giving and accepting constructive feedback
* Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not only for us as individuals but also for the community as a whole

Here are examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Use of sexualized language or images and attention or sexual advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Posting someone's private information, such as a physical address or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this code of conduct and will communicate the reasons for moderation decisions when necessary.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies in all community spaces and also applies when an individual officially represents the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Cases of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to community leaders responsible for enforcement at contact@aihub.gg. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are required to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines
